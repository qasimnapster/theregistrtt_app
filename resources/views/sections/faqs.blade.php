                        Nothing beats the feeling of unwrapping presents, and as you begin this new chapter, why not unwrap exactly what you want and need. Guests tend to give cash as a last resort, because they didn't get around to getting a gift or they're not sure exactly what you would like. With a Registry, your guests can rest assured they're getting you exactly what you'd love!

                        The whole concept of the Registry came about to make the process as simple as possible for both couple and guests. Couples can select their registry online, but we'd suggest you come in store and see everything yourself. After all, this is all part of the wedding experience! Select your items and that's it! Your guests can now search your registry online on our site, and make their purchase directly. And don't worry, we have your more traditional aunty and uncles covered. Guests are free to come in store and make their purchases as well!
